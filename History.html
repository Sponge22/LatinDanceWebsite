                        ISTD - Introduction to the British Royal Dance Teachers Association ISTD is the English Imperial Society of Teachers of Dancing acronym, the Chinese translation of the British Royal Dance Teachers Association. It is the world's leading dance exam organization. Founded in 1904, it is now a registered educational organization and is the only organization that truly covers the world and covers all dance examinations. New dance, new style, new music, through the ISTD - the British Royal Dance Teachers Association, the world's leading dance organization so that all members timely informed. IDTA --- British International Dance Teachers Association IDTA is the British International Dance Teachers Association of the English acronym, the English name is: International Dance Teachers'Association. Gu Mingsi This is an international organization related to dance teachers. Chinese dancers have heard of it, almost simultaneously with the presentation of the ISTD British Royal Dance Teachers Association. I believe that your dance teacher will be mentioned in class, this is the pace of the provisions of the ISTD, with the IDTA textbook slightly different. This is the prescribed pace of the IDTA, not in the ISTD textbook. It can be said that this is the dance lovers in the learning process most often hear two institutions. They are most famous is that they launched the world's authority of the dance teacher qualification examination and dance materials. However, ISTD is the oldest, most senior association.

                The origins of Latin dance are quite complex.
                Each of them originated in different countries, with different background, history and development course. However, most of them originated in the Americas, and they are three Cultural fusion. As early as the 16th century, the European conquerors in order to get sufficient labor and a large number of African blacks imported to the American continent, to the 17th to 18th century, from the three continents of the culture has gradually merged in the American continent. Dance as the main entertainment of the people in the middle and lower classes, naturally also fully reflects the integration of this culture, and later with the European court dancing Latin dance performance elements of the influx, these folk dance has been further standardized, evolved and improved .
                After the Second World War, the Americans spread the dance to the world, especially in Europe is widely popular. Subsequently, the Europeans of these folk dance has been standardized and processed, and finally in 1960 the Latin dance included in the world competition, and divided into Lombardy, Samba, Cha Cha, bull, cowboy five kinds of them Of the dance, beats and other aspects also have a unified requirement. Cuba is the birthplace of Latin and Latin music. Originally, Latin music and dancing were a way of celebrating victory or bumper harvests, and then gradually evolving into a way for young people to express their affection. In its development process, the Latin dance has been too enthusiastic because of the action, the expression of emotion is too straightforward and without any constraints and exclusion, but this did not affect the development of Latin dance, irresistible charm of the Latin dance eventually swept the world
