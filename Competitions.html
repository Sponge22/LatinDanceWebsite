            <h3>Blackpool Dance Festival</h3>


            <p style=¡°line-height:130%;>
                Blackpool Dance Festival is almost the top competition for all the Latin Dancers and it is considered the "Olympic" of Latin Dance.
                It seems to be an award for Latin Dancers could be there even though they don't get any awards.
                Blackpool Dance Festival was first started at 1920.
                It is holded at every May in Blackpool,a small town in the north of England.
                The Latin Dance competition is holded for 7 days including amateur and professional Latin Dancers.
                Moreover,it also includes the international Latin Dance meeting and exhibition about Latin Dance supplies.
                Most of the coutries separate the Latin Dancers in Teen,Junior,Adult,Collegiate,and Senior during the competitions.
                However, most of the Latin Dancers who join the Blackpool Dance Festival are around 20 to 30 years old.
